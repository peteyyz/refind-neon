# refind-neon

A neon theme for rEFInd. Who doesn't love neon icons?!

rEFInd: https://www.rodsbooks.com/refind/

Copy into your Refind /themes directory and add this to your refind.conf file:

include themes/neon/theme.conf

All icons and multiple backgrounds are in the /img directory.  Both transparent and black background icons are provided.

Frequently Unasked Questions:
* No, I do not use Windows 8. That's just the name that worked for the win icon.
* Yes, I have all these distros installed on two SSDs.
* Yes, it is ridiculous.
* BTW, I use Void.
* Sorry, I do use a Mac, Slackware, or BSD. I'll try to add these if there's interest.
* All icons were processed with Gimp using the Neon filter from the old Alpha To Logo collection.

Acknowledgements:
Some icons were borrowed from the excellent Metal theme: https://gitlab.com/perthshiretim/refind-metal-theme.
Some were the default rEFInd.
Some were found via image search.

Hope you like!
